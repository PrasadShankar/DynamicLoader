   /* Dynamic Loader & Plugin implementation*/

 
  I have implemented Dynamic Loader which loads .so (or plugins) and call the respective functions within the plugin.
  Also implemented plugin by using the CURL library for dowloading a file. 


  As per the architecture is concerned I came up with a design where one thread is responsible for downlaoding the file
  where the Main thread will be loading the plugin. File notification is pending , I think I have to use inotify library to 
  implement when  new plugin comes in.  File Download percentage is pending. It can be done using the curl.  
  Given more time will be able to complete all the functionalites. For HTTP download I have used the CURL library.


  I have provided two makefiles for buiding the plugin and the main application.
